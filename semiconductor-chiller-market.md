<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Semiconductor Chiller Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Water Cooled</li><li>Air Cooled</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The semiconductor chiller market is primarily divided into two types: water-cooled and air-cooled chillers. Water-cooled chillers utilize water as a cooling medium, making them highly efficient and suitable for large-scale operations where water is accessible. They typically offer better cooling capacity and energy efficiency. In contrast, air-cooled chillers rely on air for cooling and are easier to install and maintain, making them ideal for smaller facilities or locations with limited water supply. Both types cater to the cooling needs of semiconductor manufacturing.</p></p>
