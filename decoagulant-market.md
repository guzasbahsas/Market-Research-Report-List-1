<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Decoagulant Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Platelet aggregation inhibitors (PAI)</li><li>Low-molecular-weight Heparin (LMWH)</li><li>Direct thrombin inhibitor (DTI)</li><li>Direct factor Xa inhibitors (DFXa)</li><li>Vitamin K antagonists (VKA)</li><li>Others</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The decoagulant market comprises several types, each targeting different pathways in the coagulation process. Platelet aggregation inhibitors (PAI) prevent platelet clumping, reducing clot formation. Low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) is used for its anticoagulant properties with a lower risk of side effects. Direct thrombin inhibitors (DTI) directly inhibit thrombin to prevent clots, while direct factor Xa inhibitors (DFXa) target factor Xa to disrupt the coagulation cascade. Vitamin K antagonists (VKA) interfere with vitamin K metabolism, crucial for clotting factors. Other agents may include newer or combination therapies enhancing anticoagulation effects.</p></p>
